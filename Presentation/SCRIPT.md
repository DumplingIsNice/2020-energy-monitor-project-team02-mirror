# Slide 2: Analog 
- Designed resistors in a way that the maximum gain was achieved in order to increase the overall voltage levels we could represent with the micro controller. More accurate.
- Insert image of waveform with updated resistor values.
- Before: Peak to peak between 1.3V <--> 2.9V. The maximum range (VOH and VOL) we can have is 0.7V <--> 3.3V.
- After: Reached much closer to the range of the op amp as input to the ADC. The range is now 0.9V <--> 3.3V
