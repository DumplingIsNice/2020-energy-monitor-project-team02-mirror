# Firmware for Smart Energy Monitor

# Description of files:
- *main.c:* The main function, entry point of code
- *common.c:* Functions that are common to all modules (i.e. debug printing etc.)
- *uart.c:* Functions to do with communicating over the UART protocol.

- Include your final Atmel Studio project that combines work from all team members
  - Make sure to use separate modules, for example uart.c, adc.c, timer1.c, display.c, energycalculations.c, etc.
  - These modules will be copied from your own folders once finalized and validated
